## Project Structure
The repository contains multiple directories, each corresponding to a specific coding challenge. Below is an overview of the key directories and their contents:

| Directory               | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| `0x00-pascal_triangle` | Implementation of Pascal's Triangle |
| `0x01-lockboxes`       | Algorithm to determine if all lockboxes can be opened |
| `0x03-log_parsing`     | Script to parse logs and compute statistics |
| `0x04-utf8_validation` | Function to validate UTF-8 encoding |
| `0x05-nqueens`         | Solution for the N-Queens problem |
| `0x06-starwars_api`    | API request script for retrieving Star Wars characters |
| `0x07-rotate_2d_matrix` | Function to rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees |
| `0x08-making_change`   | Algorithm to compute the minimum number of coins for change |
| `0x09-island_perimeter` | Function to compute the perimeter of an island in a grid |
| `0x0A-primegame`       | Prime number game implementation |

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Tools:** Bash, Shell scripting (for execution scripts)

## Installation
To use this repository locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/johnitopaisah/alx-interview.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```sh
   cd alx-interview
   ```
3. Ensure you have Python installed:
   ```sh
   python3 --version
   ```

## Usage
Each directory contains a specific coding challenge with an executable script or function. You can navigate into a directory and run the Python file using:

```sh
python3 filename.py
```

For example, to run the **log parsing** challenge:
```sh
cd 0x03-log_parsing
python3 log_parser.py
```

## Challenges
Each challenge directory contains a problem statement, the implemented solution, and in some cases, test cases.
